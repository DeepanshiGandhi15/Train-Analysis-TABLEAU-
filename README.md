# Train-Analysis
## Description :
I conducted a comprehensive train analysis using Tableau, focusing on various aspects including customer classification, express shipment details, material weight pricing, international orders, order dates, associated costs, transportation methods, and remote locations.<br> <br>
Throughout the analysis process, I developed different visualizations to represent these factors effectively. <br> <br> 
Finally, I synthesized these visualizations into an interactive dashboard for a comprehensive overview of the train-related data.<br> <br>
To enhance user interactivity, I implemented parameters and calculated fields in the Tableau analysis. Parameters allow users to dynamically adjust certain aspects of the visualization, providing flexibility and customization. Calculated fields enable the creation of new data elements based on existing ones, facilitating deeper analysis and insights. <br> <br> 
By incorporating parameters and calculated fields, the analysis becomes more user-friendly and adaptable to varying user needs and preferences.<br> <br>
Here's a glimpse of the dashboard. <br>
